### INTRODUCTION
The globe is full of transportation networks. primarily buses, trains, airplanes, etc. In addition to using the train system, some people also travel by bus and airplane. Generally speaking, ticket prices for airline travel are higher than for other modes of transportation. We can easily move from one place to another because of the journey distance, which makes them more expensive. Also, as a result of ignorance, most people spend more money and are unaware of when prices are high and low. Thus, we are able to forecast the flight cost in our project and determine when it is high and when it is low. Here, we may use the Random Forest machine learning technique to forecast the flight cost by taking into account the origin, destination, departure and arrival times, number of stops, airlines, and other factors. Using the Random Forest Algorithm, we can use this information to estimate flight fares and inform clients of either high or cheap ticket prices. High performance accuracy was demonstrated by our research in Random forest,the obtained accuracy is 82.82%.
